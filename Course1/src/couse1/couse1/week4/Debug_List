when creating a new graph as a deep copy of another graph, reverse so that adjacency list is in same order as original. Ref:

String vs StringBuilder

Add main function to unit test your Graph class

The graph is dense. Should we use adjacency matrix?

No need to evaluate the performance of your current implementation. Just correct it and implement the Union Find data structure. Be smart!
